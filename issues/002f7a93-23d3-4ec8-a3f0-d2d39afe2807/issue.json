  "subject": "Improve merge strategy",
  "description": "Right now the merge conflicts are resolved by using the remote data, only text data could be in conflict anytime.\nThis will be improved in two steps\n1- Merge and commit the content of the text and resolve it manually.\n2- Present a UI to merge the data and then commit\n\nSince only text of the issues, comments and descriptions could be in conflict, this UI could be a list of the conflict text to be resolved one by one",
